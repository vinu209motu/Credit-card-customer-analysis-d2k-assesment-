# Credit card customer analysis d2k assesment 
This project involves analyzing credit card customer data using Google Colab. The goal was to explore customer behavior, segment users, and predict churn using machine learning techniques.

What I Did :

Loaded and Cleaned the Dataset: Used pandas to handle missing values and preprocess data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key trends using matplotlib and seaborn.

Customer Segmentation: Applied clustering techniques to group similar customers.

Churn Prediction Model: Built and evaluated a machine learning model to predict customer churn.

GitHub Integration: Uploaded the notebook and dataset to GitHub for version control.

How to Run :

Open Google Colab.

Load the notebook from GitHub.

Run each cell to execute the analysis and model training.

Key Insights :

The churn prediction model achieved an accuracy of 0.85.

High spenders generally have lower churn rates.

Customers with low credit limits and fewer transactions are more likely to leave.
